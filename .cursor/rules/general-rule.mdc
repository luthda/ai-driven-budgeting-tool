- Use functional components only; no class components.
- Strictly adhere to TypeScript with explicit typing; avoid any types unless absolutely necessary.
- Follow modern ES6+ JavaScript practices (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await).
- Keep components small, focused, and maintainable (one component per file).
