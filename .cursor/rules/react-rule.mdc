- Always prefer hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) for state management.
- Avoid deeply nested state; prefer multiple smaller, simpler state variables.
- Use TanStack Router for type-safe, declarative routing.
- Use React Query (TanStack Query) for server-state management and caching.
- Follow single-responsibility principle (SRP) for components; each component should do one thing clearly.
