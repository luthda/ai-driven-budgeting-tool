### Component Splitting and Page Structure

#### Key Learnings

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Layout components should be at the page level, not within form components
   - Generic components should stay focused on their core functionality
   - Specialized components should handle specific use cases
   - This makes components more reusable and maintainable

2. **Component Hierarchy**

   - Pages handle layout and composition
   - Feature components focus on business logic and form state
   - UI components are pure presentational components
   - Clear hierarchy: Page → Feature → UI Components

3. **Props and Interfaces**

   - Components should have clear, focused prop interfaces
   - Generic components should be truly generic
   - Props should be explicit and well-typed
   - Makes components more predictable and easier to use

4. **State Management**

   - State should be managed at the appropriate level
   - Form state belongs in form components
   - UI state belongs in UI components
   - Prevents prop drilling and keeps state close to where it's used

5. **Reusability**

   - Components should be as reusable as possible
   - Specialized functionality should be split into separate components
   - Allows for better code reuse and easier testing

6. **File Structure**

   - Components should be organized by their purpose
   - Auth-related components in `auth/`
   - Form components in `form/`
   - UI components in `ui/`
   - Makes the codebase more navigable and maintainable

7. **Consistency**
   - Components should follow consistent patterns
   - Similar components should have similar interfaces
   - Makes the codebase more predictable and easier to work with

#### Patterns Identified

1. **Component Organization Pattern**

   ```
   frontend/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── components/
   │   │   ├── ui/          # Generic UI components
   │   │   ├── form/        # Form-specific components
   │   │   └── auth/        # Auth-specific components
   │   ├── pages/           # Page components
   │   └── routes/          # Route definitions
   ```

2. **Component Hierarchy Pattern**

   ```typescript
   // Page Component (Layout + Composition)
   export default function Signup() {
     return (
       <AuthLayout>
         <SignupForm />
       </AuthLayout>
     )
   }

   // Feature Component (Business Logic)
   export const SignupForm = () => {
     // Form state and logic
     return <form>...</form>
   }

   // UI Component (Presentation)
   export const FormInput = () => {
     // Pure presentation
     return <input />
   }
   ```

3. **Component Interface Pattern**

   ```typescript
   // Generic Component
   interface FormInputProps {
     label: string
     error?: FieldError
   }

   // Specialized Component
   interface PasswordInputProps extends FormInputProps {
     // Additional password-specific props
   }
   ```

#### Alignment with General Rules

- ✅ Using functional components and hooks
- ✅ Favoring modularization and reusable components
- ✅ Following clear file structure
- ✅ Using TypeScript with explicit type definitions
- ✅ Maintaining consistent patterns across the codebase

#### Next Steps

1. Apply these patterns to other components in the project
2. Create additional specialized components for other form fields
3. Refactor other parts of the application to follow these patterns
4. Document any additional patterns or learnings as they emerge
