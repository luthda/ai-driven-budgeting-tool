## Context and Problem Statement

We require a robust yet straightforward backend framework for our budgeting application. Our priority is ease of use, wide adoption, simple integration with MongoDB, and flexibility.

---

## Options Considered

| Option               | Pros                                        | Cons                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Express.js**       | ✅ Simple, lightweight, widely adopted      | ❌ Minimal built-in structure        |
| **NestJS**           | ✅ Structured, scalable, TypeScript-focused | ❌ Higher initial complexity         |
| **Serverless (AWS)** | ✅ Minimal infrastructure overhead          | ❌ Complexity in managing serverless |

---

## Decision

We choose **Express.js (Node.js)** as our backend solution.

---

## Rationale

- **Simplicity & Flexibility**: Express is minimalistic, straightforward to set up, and maintain.
- **MEAN Stack Integration**: Seamless integration with MongoDB and React frontend.
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Express offers excellent tooling, middleware, and a large supportive community.

---

## Implications

- Manual implementation of middleware and security best practices.
- High flexibility to evolve backend structure as project grows.

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                           | Impact | Mitigation                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lack of Built-in Structure** | Medium | Clearly define backend architecture and conventions upfront |

---

## Next Steps

- Scaffold backend project structure with Express.js.
- Establish clear API structure, middleware, and validation strategies early in the project.
