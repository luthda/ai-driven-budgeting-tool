## Architecture Overview

This diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of our AI-driven budgeting tool. The system is built with a modern, scalable stack that includes:

1. **Frontend Layer**

   - React SPA built with Vite.js
   - Hosted on static hosting services (Netlify/Cloudflare)
   - Optimized for mobile devices

2. **Backend Layer**

   - Node.js + Express.js server
   - RESTful API architecture
   - Middleware for validation and request processing
   - Authentication handled via third-party services (Clerk/Auth0)

3. **Database Layer**
   - MongoDB as the primary database
   - Managed through MongoDB Atlas for scalability and reliability

The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns and is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure. Each layer communicates through well-defined interfaces, primarily using REST APIs over HTTPS.
